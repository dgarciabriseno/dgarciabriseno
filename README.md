### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the account I use for working on [Helioviewer](https://helioviewer.org) and related projects. Consider this my "business" account.
I didn't know that github recommends using one profile for work and play, so I have two accounts.
My other one is [dangarbri](https://github.com/dangarbri)
